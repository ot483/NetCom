The following outputs are generated by NetCom:

-T1/T2_ECs: enzymatic reactions that are differentially abundant in one of the treatments (according to user's input file)
-T1/T2_resources: a list of compounds (KEGG accessions) that were predicted as treatment-specific environmental resources
-T1/T2_compounds: all compounds included in the treatment-specific network expanded for the treatment (KEGG accessions)
-T1/T2_Enymes_pathways: pathways that are enriched with environmental resources that are unique to the treatment
-T1/T2_resource_pathways: pathways that are enriched with treatment-specific environmental resources
-T1/T2_pathways: pathways that are enriched with compounds that are unique to the treatment
-3D_network_T1/T2: html files with 3D networks of the full treatment network or of specific pathways that are enriched with compounds that are unique to the treatment
-T1/T1_Network: high resolution figure file of the 2D network
